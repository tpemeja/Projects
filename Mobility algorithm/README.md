# Ant colony simulation and behavior optimization
Project realized in 2019 with Maxime ROSAY.

[Algo_mob_2019.pdf](Algo_mob_2019.pdf) is a French report of this project, describing more precisely the work done and explained below.

## Pre-requesties :
- [JBotSim](https://jbotsim.io/) : simulation library for distributed algorithms in dynamic networks

## Project description
The goal of this project is to reproduce the behavior of a ant colony described in French on the following website [Exploration par des fourmis](https://www.labri.fr/perso/acasteig/teaching/algomob/practice/?p=ants-fr).

The project was divided into two main parts:
- Setup of the ant colony and the environment
- Improve the behavior of the ants to survive longer by using pheromones
