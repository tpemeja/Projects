# Connect Four project
Personal project realized in 2021 to practice object-oriented programming, data generation and game visualization with [IPython](https://ipython.org/).

## Project description
The goal of the project is to reproduce the project of Goban but for the Connect Four game. This project is divided into four main parts:
- [x] Implement the Connect Four game with game visualization
- [ ] Generate data to feed the neural network (**In progress**)
- [ ] Define a neural network model for the heuristic
- [ ] Create a player for the game using the heuristic

[Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) is a **solved game**. It might be interesting to know if the player, based on a neural network trained with all possible games, will follow the strategy and force the victory.
