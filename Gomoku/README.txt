Tree
------------
/src : source folder
/src/players : contains all player code and their heuristic
/src/server : contains server and bitboard
/src/test : contains test files
/Makefile
/README
/build_Debug : folder for development, created by command make
/install : main installation folder, created by command make install
/doc/doxygen/ : all doxygen generated documentation

Pre-requesties :
-------------
C compiler
doxygen
make
lib thread (on Windows) : download at https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Personal%20Builds/rubenvb/gcc-4.7-experimental-stdthread/

Compilation :
-------------
make : to compile in the build_Debug folder
make install : to transfer all executable files into install folder, will call command make if files are not created

each player may be compiled separately :
make build_Debug/playerN.so : to compile playerN

Execution :
-----------
go in install folder
./server -n 10 -o playerA.so playerB.so
where -n is used to give the size of the board
and -o pass the game in swap mode (with opening proposal)
Player B will play first

Test :
------
make test : computes global tests
make test full=ON : computes results for all test

Documentation :
